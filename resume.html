    <h2>INTERNSHIP</h2>
    <h3>Tamil Nadu government NAAN MUDHALVAN Scheme:</h3>
    <p>The NAAN MUDHALVAN internship, sponsored by the Tamil Nadu government, focuses on developing a perfume purchasing website to participants' web development skills comprehensively. It covers frontend design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, backend integration using technologies like Node.js or Python Django, and e-commerce functionalities such as product catalog management, shopping cart, payment gateway integration, and order processing. Through hands-on experience in a real-world project, interns will learn team collaboration, coding best practices enhance, and problem-solving, preparing them for careers in software engineering and web development.</p>

    <h2>PAPER PUBLICATION</h2>
    <h3>Title: Two level Authentication for E- Voting system using IOT technology.(.tjarset)</h3>
    <p>Two-level authentication for an e-voting system using IoT technology enhances security by requiring voters to verify their identity through two distinct methods. Typically, this involves a combination of something the voter knows (e.g. a password or PIN) and something the voter has (e.g. a smartphone or biometric device). This dual layered approach significantly reduces the risk of fraud and unauthorized access, ensuring a more secure and trustworthy e-voting process.</p>

            <strong>IOT Based Integrated Smart Helmet System to prevent Rider's Safety</strong><br>
            Motorcycle safety remains a critical concern due to the vulnerability of riders in accidents and the potential for impaired driving. This study suggests an Integrated Smart Helmet System (ISHS) with cutting-edge technologies to improve motorcycle safety in order to address these issues. The three main functions of the ISHS are environmental regulation, accident monitoring, and alcohol detection.
